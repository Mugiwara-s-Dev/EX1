Description:
MugiDev is a development company born from the value of unity and teamwork. Inspired by the Mugiwara crew, 
we believe the best projects are built when each member contributes their talent toward a common goal. 
We create solid, collaborative digital solutions designed to grow alongside our clients.

Proposal 1:
A web platform that uses AI to scan the client’s head and, based on this, allows them to customize and change 
their hairstyle to their liking, either through prompts or by merging images.

Proposal 2:
A web page with an interactive map that allows users to search for specific items, especially those that are 
difficult to find, and see which stores in the city have them available. When a search is performed, the system 
shows nearby stores that carry the product, their exact location, and the easiest route to get there, 
saving users time and directly connecting them with local businesses.

Proposal 3:
It is a hair salon that integrates an intelligent software system for appointment scheduling and time management, 
allowing clients to book services online based on real availability, while enabling the business to organize shifts, 
manage schedules, prevent overlapping appointments, and optimize staff workflow, improving both operational efficiency and customer experience.
